# **Fracturia**
*A world shattered. A myth reborn.*

Fracturia is an ambitious Minecraft expansion mod designed to enrich nearly every aspect of the game while introducing an original, immersive lore spanning **nine celestial dimensions**.  
Each realm is ruled by a member of the enigmatic **Celestial Executors**, ancient beings whose power once shaped the universe… and whose downfall is now inevitable.

Explore new worlds, uncover forgotten histories, battle divine rulers, and shape your own path through a fractured cosmos.

# **📜 Update 1 — Rise of Arkonie**
*The Fracture begins.*

**Rise of Arkonie** introduces the first of the nine dimensions: **Arkonia** — a realm built upon the remnants of a forgotten End, twisted and unstable.

### **🌑 Arkonia**
Arkonia presents itself as a distorted echo of another world, shaped by forces long since diminished.  
Its landscapes carry the mark of a place that once held significance — now reduced to a bleak, fractured domain.

- 🟣 **Environment**: inspired by the End, but darker, older, and marked by decay.  
- ⚔️ **New Mobs**: remnants of extinct creations, corrupted end-creatures, and hybrid entities born from unstable cosmic matter.  
- 🧿 **Exploration-Focused**: scattered relics and cryptic hints gently guide players toward the truth behind this fallen realm.

### **👁️ The Celestial Executor of Arkonia**
Arkonia is ruled by the **9th Executor**, the weakest of the nine — yet still a being of immense power.  

Your journey begins with their fall.
